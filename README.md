Here are some 3D models for a custom breadboard just in case you need it for some project. It's here with and without the logo and feet that hold it onto a PCB.
There are also 3D models for the spring contacts that can mount to a PCB, I'm having these custom made so If you hit me up I can get some to you.

Eventually they'll be up on my [Tindie store](https://www.tindie.com/stores/architeuthisflux/)

The Fusion 360 files are too big to upload so you can find them here at [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11HrEiID-8ZzCqb49P2APxQiNuQDPLGXm?usp=share_link)
